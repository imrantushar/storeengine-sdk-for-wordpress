license enforcement, streamline product updates, and provide valuable insights—all while reducing your development overhead.

## Installation

There are two ways to install this SDK.

1. Download the latest release version and include it in your project like you would with any other third-party library.
2. Install via composer.

### Download and use as 3rd Party library

Download the latest [release file](https://github.com/imrantushar/storeengine-sdk-for-wordpress/releases/latest) and extract in a folder (e.g `library/storeengine`) of your plugin/theme.
Now include the `init.php` file in your plugin/theme. This file must be loaded before the `plugins_loaded` hook.

```php
require_once __DIR__ . '/library/storeengine/init.php'
```

### Install via Composer

To install via `composer` please add this repository in your project's `composer.json` file. Then require `storeengine/wordpress-sdk`.
_This SDK is not yet available in [packagist.org](https://packagist.org/) (will be available soon)._

```json
{
	"repositories": [
		{
			"type": "vcs",
			"url": "https://github.com/imrantushar/storeengine-sdk-for-wordpress.git"
		}
	],
	"require": {
		"storeengine/wordpress-sdk": "^1.0"
	}
}
```

Then run composer update command from the terminal.

```bash
composer update
```

Include the Composer autoloader in your plugin/theme.

```php
require_once __DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php'
```

> **PS:** Don’t worry about “class/function already exists” errors or version conflicts when other plugins or themes use this SDK.
> <br>
> The SDK is designed with a fail-safe mechanism that always loads the latest available version if multiple copies are found within a WordPress installation.

## Usage

Integrating the SDK into your plugin or theme is designed to be drop-in simple.
The core entry point is a single helper function: `se_license_init()`, which wires up licensing, updates, and insights
automatically for your product.

This function should be called as early as possible within the WordPress load order — typically on the `plugins_loaded` hook.

```php
add_action( 'plugins_loaded', function () {
	se_license_init( [
		'package_file'        => __FILE__,
		'package_name'        => __( 'Your Amazing Plugin', 'textdomain'),
		'product_id'          => 27870,
		'is_free'             => false,
		'slug'                => 'your-amazing-plugin',
		'basename'            => plugin_basename( __FILE__ ),
		'package_type'        => 'plugin',
		'package_version'     => '1.0.0',
		'license_server'      => 'https://your-website.com',
		'product_logo'        => plugins_url( 'assets/images/logo.svg', __FILE__ ),
		'store_dashboard_url' => 'https://your-website.com/store-dashboard/license-keys/',
		'terms_url'           => 'https://your-website.com/terms-and-conditions/',
		'privacy_policy_url'  => 'https://your-website.com/privacy-policy/',
		'ticket_recipient'    => 'support@your-website.com',
	] );
} );
```

### How it works
- Automatic versioning & failsafe loading: If multiple plugins or themes bundle this SDK, WordPress will always load the
latest version automatically, preventing conflicts or duplicate class errors.
- Seamless UI integration: A “Manage License” menu item is automatically created for your users, with customizable branding (logo).
- Secure API communication: All license activations, deactivations, and update checks are routed securely through your
StoreEngine-powered server.
- Future extensibility: Once enabled, upcoming features like usage analytics and in-product promotions (upcoming) can be
toggled on with minimal additional code.


> **For Plugin:** Call `se_license_init()` from the main plugin file (`your-plugin-slug/your-plugin-slug.php`).
